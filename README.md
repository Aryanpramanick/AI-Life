In the intricate landscape of financial markets, the act of trading stocks is a multifaceted process that involves a myriad of variables, uncertainties, and
decision-making mechanisms. Studies in this field have led to the formulation of multiple mathematical and computational models that attempt to explain
how an individual makes decisions about purchasing stocks. One such model is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) (Perold, 2004), which describes the
relationship between systematic risk (the general perils of investing) and the expected returns. This model is still widely used in the industry due to its
simplicity and ease of use. However, there are some limitations to such models. CAPM makes unreliable assumptions based on its assumption of a linear
relationship between risk and return. Therefore, understanding the decision-making process of stock trading goes beyond the conventional models that
assume perfect rationality and market efficiency.
This is where we use Genetic Algorithms to circumvent these issues.
